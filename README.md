# sieve

sieve is intented to be used to remove the unneeded information from movie/tv show torrent folder/file names 
and its goal is to take in an un-filtered torrent file and output the correct movie or tv show name

Developement Steps:
  1. write the algorithm that will filter the names
  2. design and create the TUI, TUI will take in a path
      sieve [-d] PATH/S
      PATHs will be a list of paths to either files or folders
      -d paths that point to folders will iterate over the folders contents
  3. create a GUI which will allow for easier selecting and editing
